<h2>About Pronghorn</h2>  
Pronghorn <i>(Antilocapra americana) </i> is the only living representative of the genus Pronghorn. It is the fastest animal in North America, which can reach up to 95km/h, making jumps up to 6 meters long. In the first half of the twentieth century, due to the conversion of the prairie into agricultural land, the pronghorn population decreased significantly. At that time, the hunting of these antelopes was banned and they were re-settled in formerly occupied areas, as a result of which many farmers had to leave their farms. The pronghorn antelope has become a symbol of environmental protection in Canada and the United States. This animal was chosen as mascot for this project to raise awareness, that limiting the impact of the human footprint and restoring the natural habitats of animals may cause the population of endangered species to increase significantly in a short time.
